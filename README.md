# ngW3css

## Introduction
  A new angular module to work with [W3css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css).

## How to use
  1. Add W3css.css to you project.
  2. Add ngW3css.js to you project.
  3. Add to your module "ngW3css". Eg. angular.module("app", ["ngW3css"]);
  4. Now you can utilize all directives.
  
## Directives

#### Parameter Directives
  - w3-hide-target: Is to add a class "w3-hide" and remove class "w3-show" by ID pr Class.
  - w3-show-target: Is to add a class "w3-show" and remove class "w3-hide" by ID pr Class.

    - w3-overlay class.
    - w3-opennav class.
    - w3-closen.
    - main element. (Just if you want to have an offcanvas effect).
